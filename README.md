# My ADK Agent

This project is a prototype AI agent built using the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. It demonstrates how to set up and run a basic agent workflow locally using Python and ADK tools. The agent uses large language models and tool integrations to respond to queries.

## Features
- Simple ADK agent setup
- Uses Python & ADK configuration
- Demonstrates basic agent responses and tools

## Tech Stack
Python, ADK, Jupyter Notebook

## Setup
1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create a `.env` file with required API keys

## Run
- Open and run the Jupyter notebook (`sample.ipynb`)
- Explore the agent logic interactively
