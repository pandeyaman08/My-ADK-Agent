# My ADK Agent

My ADK Agent is an AI agent prototype built using the Agent Development Kit (ADK).  
The project demonstrates how to setup and run a basic ADK agent using Python and a sample Jupyter notebook.

## Features
- Setup a simple AI agent using the ADK framework
- Includes a Jupyter notebook to interact with and test agent logic
- Demonstrates basic agent operations and configuration

## Tech Stack
Python, Agent Development Kit (ADK), Jupyter Notebook

## Setup
1. Create a Python virtual environment  
   `python -m venv .venv`  
2. Activate the environment and install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Open `sample.ipynb` and run the notebook to experiment with the agent.

## How to Use
- Run the notebook to interact with the agent logic and see example outputs.
